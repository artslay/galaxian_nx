/* patch.c -- game-specific patches for libgodot_android.so (Mega Man X
 * Galaxy on Fire, Godot 4.7 arm64-v8a). Offsets were derived from the v1.00.61 APK;
 * the engine binary is byte-identical in 1.00.7, 1.00.8, 1.00.91 and 1.00.92 (md5
 * 5515d98fff588d6c2f8d20e64cd85a3a). They are validated against the
 * original instruction bytes before patching (a mismatch is logged and
 * skipped, never applied blind).
 *
 * Retargeted from delson's smwr_nx patch (Godot 4.6.dev4). The can_capture_pointer
 * offset below was re-derived for the 1.00.61 binary from an on-hardware crash
 * (see the per-define note). Offsets shift between game versions, so if a boot log
 * shows a Data Abort inside DisplayServerAndroid at some OTHER godot+0xADDR, that's
 * a further null-view getter whose offset needs re-deriving and adding here.
 *
 * Two kinds of patch are supported (see GamePatch):
 *   - whole-function hook  (repl != NULL): redirect the function to a C replacement.
 *   - single-word rewrite  (repl == NULL): overwrite one instruction word in place.
 * Both verify the original word first and patch by ADDRESS, never by byte pattern.

// Rewriting the bfxil to a bfc clears the enabled bit unconditionally, so any
// canvas light the game enables through this call ends up disabled instead.
// WHY THIS MUST STAY: the game's full-screen DirectionalLight2D (FX/ambient_light,
// present in the levels -- intro_level, fire_level, ...) is enabled when a level
// loads and TDRs the GPU (device lost) on this console -- a hard GPU freeze the
// moment you pick a save slot + difficulty and the first level loads. Forcing it
// off keeps the GPU alive; sprites render fine, just unlit. This was once removed
// as "dead code" (menu point-lights are unaffected and stay visible, so it LOOKED
// inert) and it brought the freeze back -- do not remove it. Word is verified
// before patching, and the engine binary is the same in every version checked (see top).
