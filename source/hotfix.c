/* hotfix.c -- self-healing fixes for game data known to be missing/broken in

 *
 * For Galaxy on Fire (Godot 4.7) no missing/broken asset is known yet,
 * so apply_asset_hotfixes() is a no-op. The write_if_missing() helper is kept
 * ready: if a first-boot log shows an unguarded FileAccess.open on a file the
 * APK export dropped (the pattern that bit the SMWR credits.txt), embed the
 * file's bytes and restore it here. MIT license; see LICENSE. */
